Partition a set containing N integers, into two sets s1, s2, so that |sum(l1)-sum(l2)| is minimised.

This problem is perhaps even more general than 0/1 knapsack problem and is considered by Garey and Johnsons as one of the six basic NP-hard problems that lie at 
the heart of NP-completeness theory.
It has applications in multiprocessor scheduling, VLSI layout, and perhaps most famously, public kay cryptography.

In Programming contests, the problem sometimes shows up in the form of children picking sides in a ball game that the game is fair.

Input:
   A set of integers, S;

output: 
  For each integer i in s, a 0, 1 indicating which side of the patition it is on.
