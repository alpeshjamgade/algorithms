Instead of N items (as in 0/1 knapsack problem), you are given M types of items,  each type having a bounded quantity.

Input:
   some set of M types of items, each item type m having bounded quantity q[m] and associated with weight w[m] and profit p[m]/
   A maximum weight W.

output:
  The amount of each type of item should be included in the knapsack to maximize profit sum without exceeding weight capacity W and subject to the bounded quantiy the
  bounded quantity for each item type.
